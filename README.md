# Basic Webpack Boilerplate

With the following features:

* Sass compiled to css in an external stylesheet
* ES2015
* React and ReactDOM
* An app directory for development and a dist folder for builds
* Static compilation of jpg and png images
* Nothing else

### To use this on a new project
* Clone the repo!
* Change the remote!
* Install the packages with `npm install`!
* To start the dev server run `webpack-dev-server --progress --colors`
  * Your project is now live at 'localhost:8080' and livereloaded on change at 'localhost:8080/webpack-dev-server'
* To build your assets into the `dist` directory run `webpack`
* **NEVER TOUCH THE CONTENTS OF THE DIST FOLDER**
* Build whatever you like in the app folder

=============================================
# This is a re-do of the original 'Best of' group project with these goals:

* 1 Use React instead of Backbone
* 2 Complete the project to at least Explorer mode 
* 3 Create a README.md file with information on the project, including names of contributors.  

-----------------
### Explorer Mode

Users should be able to:

*View a sorted list of the "best" items on your site
*Submit new suggestions for a "best" item
*Vote for a "best" item (there is no requirement to limit votes per person)

----------------------------------------------
### Adventure Mode

* Users should be able to search or Filter "best" items
* Pagination for "best" items
* Users should be able to keep track of items they would like to try
* Restrict so more than one person cannot submit the same 

----------------------------------------------
