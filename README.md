# This is a re-do of the original 'Best of' group project with these goals:

* Use React instead of Backbone
* Complete the project to at least Explorer mode 
* Create a README.md file with information on the project, including names of contributors.  

-----------------
### Explorer Mode

Users should be able to:

* View a sorted list of the "best" items on your site
* Submit new suggestions for a "best" item
* Vote for a "best" item (there is no requirement to limit votes per person)

----------------------------------------------
### Adventure Mode

* Users should be able to search or Filter "best" items
* Pagination for "best" items
* Users should be able to keep track of items they would like to try
* Restrict so more than one person cannot submit the same 

----------------------------------------------
### Project uses the following:

* Webpack Boilerplate  
* React
* Backbone models and collections  

----------------------------------------------
